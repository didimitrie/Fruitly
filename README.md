Fruitly
=======

What: 
Fruitly is an application that promotes eating vegetables and fruits that are in season, in the place you're living in.

Why: 
* to reduce the energy (and associated CO2 emissions) needed to grow and transport the food we eat
* to avoid paying a premium for food that is scarcer or has travelled a long way
* to support the local economy
* to reconnect with nature's cycles and the passing of time

but, most importantly, because:
seasonal food is fresher and so tends to be tastier and more nutritious

Fruitly's song: "Time Of The Season"
